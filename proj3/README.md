## Stuff to Know
All the code that was written for this assignment is within /src/. 

## How SuperBall works:
### A typical game of SuperBall has 5 colors, all worth different amounts of points:
  Purple = 2
  Blue = 3
  Yellow = 4
  Red = 5
  Green = 6
A command to run a game of superball would use the colors pbyrg, which represents the colors in increasing order by points.
### The actual run command looks like this:
  -8 10 5 pbyrg
  -Where 
    -8 is the number of rows
    -10 is the number of columns
    -5 is the minmum amount of connections to score a group
    -pbyrg is the colors in increasing order
